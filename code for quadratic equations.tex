This is problem 2.2from Exercise 4.2
\begin{enumerate}
\item Type your question \\
 A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of production of each  toy was found to be 55 minus the number of toys produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was Rs 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.
 
\solution\\
let the number of toys produced on that be x
therefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day=55-x
so, the total cost of production that day =
\myvec{{x\times(55-x)}=750}\\
\myvec{55\times x-x^2}\\
\myvec{-x^2+55x-750=0}\\
 hence the equation is\myvec{x^2-55x+750=0}\\

\end{enumerate}
